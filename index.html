    </li>
    <li> 
          Blocking Collective MPI Benchmarks: Collective latency tests for various MPI
          collective operations such as
          MPI_Allgather, MPI_Alltoall, MPI_Allreduce, MPI_Barrier, MPI_Bcast,
          MPI_Gather, MPI_Reduce, MPI_Reduce_Scatter, MPI_Scatter and vector

Please note that there are many different ways to measure these
performance parameters. For example, the bandwidth test can have
different variations regarding the types of MPI calls (blocking
vs. non-blocking) being used, total number of back-to-back messages
sent in one iteration, number of iterations, etc.  Other ways to
measure bandwidth may give different numbers.  Readers are welcome to
use other tests, as appropriate to their application environments.

<li><strong>osu_latency</strong> - Latency Test </li>
The latency tests are carried out in a ping-pong fashion. The sender
sends a message with a certain data size to the receiver and waits for a
reply from the receiver. The receiver receives the message from the sender
and sends back a reply with the same data size. Many iterations of this
ping-pong test are carried out and average one-way latency numbers are
obtained. Blocking version of MPI functions (MPI_Send and MPI_Recv) are
used in the tests.

<li><strong>osu_latency_mt</strong> - Multi-threaded Latency Test</li>
The multi-threaded latency test performs a ping-pong test with a single
sender process and multiple threads on the receiving process. In this test
the sending process sends a message of a given data size to the receiver
and waits for a reply from the receiver process. The receiving process has
a variable number of receiving threads (set by default to 2), where each
thread calls MPI_Recv and upon receiving a message sends back a response
of equal size. Many iterations are performed and the average one-way
latency numbers are reported. Users can modify the number of communicating
threads being used by using the "-t" runtime option.  Examples:
            -t 4        // receiver threads = 4 and sender threads = 1
            -t 4:6      // sender threads = 4 and receiver threads = 6
            -t 2:       // not defined

<li><strong>osu_latency_mp</strong> - Multi-process Latency Test</li>
The multi-process latency test performs a ping-pong test with a single
sender process and a single receiver process, both having one or more
child processes that are spawned using the fork() system call. In this test
the sending process(parent) sends a message of a given data size to the
receiver(parent) process and waits for a reply from the receiver process. 
Both the sending and receiving process have a variable number of child
processes (set by default to 1 child process), where each child process
sleeps for 2 seconds after the fork call and exits. The parent processes 
carry out the ping-pong test where many iterations are performed and the 
average one-way latency numbers are reported. This test is available here.
"-t" option can be used to set the number of sender and receiver processes
including the parent processes to be used in a benchmark.

Examples:
           -t 4        // receiver processes = 4 and sender processes = 1 
           -t 4:6      // sender processes = 4 and receiver processes = 6
           -t 2:       // not defined

The purpose of this test is to check if the underlying MPI communication
runtime has taken care of fork safety even if the application has not.

A new environment variable "MV2_SUPPORT_FORK_SAFETY" was introduced with
MVAPICH2 2.3.4 to make MVAPICH2 takes care of fork safety for
applications that require it.

The support for fork safety is disabled by default in MVAPICH2 due to
performance reasons. When running osu_latency_mp with MVAPICH2, set
the environment variable MV2_SUPPORT_FORK_SAFETY to 1. When running
osu_latency_mp with other MPI libraries that do not support fork safety,
set the environment variables RDMAV_FORK_SAFE or IBV_FORK_SAFE to 1.

<li><strong>osu_bw</strong> - Bandwidth Test</li>
The bandwidth tests are carried out by having the sender sending out a
fixed number (equal to the window size) of back-to-back messages to the
receiver and then waiting for a reply from the receiver. The receiver
sends the reply only after receiving all these messages. This process is
repeated for several iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on
the elapsed time (from the time sender sends the first message until the
time it receives the reply back from the receiver) and the number of bytes
sent by the sender. The objective of this bandwidth test is to determine
the maximum sustained date rate that can be achieved at the network level.
Thus, non-blocking version of MPI functions (MPI_Isend and MPI_Irecv) are
used in the test.

<li><strong>osu_bibw</strong> - Bidirectional Bandwidth Test</li>
The bidirectional bandwidth test is similar to the bandwidth test, except
that both the nodes involved send out a fixed number of back-to-back
messages and wait for the reply. This test measures the maximum
sustainable aggregate bandwidth by two nodes.

<li><strong>osu_mbw_mr</strong> - Multiple Bandwidth / Message Rate Test</li>
The multi-pair bandwidth and message rate test evaluates the aggregate
uni-directional bandwidth and message rate between multiple pairs of
processes. Each of the sending processes sends a fixed number of messages
(the window size) back-to-back to the paired receiving process before
waiting for a reply from the receiver. This process is repeated for
several iterations. The objective of this benchmark is to determine the
achieved bandwidth and message rate from one node to another node with a
configurable number of processes running on each node.

<li><strong>osu_multi_lat</strong> - Multi-pair Latency Test</li>
This test is very similar to the latency test. However, at the same 
instant multiple pairs are performing the same test simultaneously.
In order to perform the test across just two nodes the hostnames must
be specified in block fashion.

The latest OMB version includes benchmarks for various MPI blocking 
collective operations (MPI_Allgather, MPI_Alltoall, MPI_Allreduce, 
MPI_Barrier, MPI_Bcast, MPI_Gather, MPI_Reduce, MPI_Reduce_Scatter, 
MPI_Scatter and vector collectives). These benchmarks work in the
following manner.  Suppose users run the osu_bcast benchmark with N
processes, the benchmark measures the min, max and the average latency of
the MPI_Bcast collective operation across N processes, for various
message lengths, over a large number of iterations. In the default
version, these benchmarks report the average latency for each message
length. Additionally, the benchmarks offer the following options:
"-f" can be used to report additional statistics of the benchmark,
     such as min and max latencies and the number of iterations.
"-m" option can be used to set the minimum and maximum message length
     to be used in a benchmark. In the default version, the benchmarks
     report the latencies for up to 1MB message lengths. Examples:
       -m 128    // min = default, max = 128
       -m 2:128  // min = 2, max = 128
       -m 2:     // min = 2, max = default
"-x" can be used to set the number of warmup iterations to skip for each
     message length.
"-i" can be used to set the number of iterations to run for each message
     length.
"-M" can be used to set per process maximum memory consumption.  By
     default the benchmarks are limited to 512MB allocations.

In addition to the blocking collective latency tests mentioned above, we
provide several non-blocking collectives (NBC): MPI_Iallgather, MPI_Iallgatherv, 
MPI_Iallreduce, MPI_Ialltoall, MPI_Ialltoallv, MPI_Ialltoallw, MPI_Ibarrier, MPI_Ibcast,
MPI_Igather, MPI_Igatherv, MPI_Ireduce, MPI_Iscatter, and MPI_Iscatterv.
These evaluate the same metrics as the blocking operations as well as the 
additional metric `overlap'.  This is defined as the amount of computation that can be
performed while the communication progresses in the background.
These benchmarks have the additional options:
"-t" set the number of MPI_Test() calls during the dummy computation, set
     CALLS to 100, 1000, or any number &gt; 0. 
"-r" set the target for dummy computation that imitates the effect of useful
computation that can be overlapped with the communication, as we provide CUDA-Aware support for NBC as well, this option can be set to CPU, GPU, or
BOTH.

<li><strong>osu_put_latency</strong> - Latency Test for Put with Active/Passive Synchronization</li>
The put latency benchmark includes window initialization operations
(MPI_Win_create, MPI_Win_allocate and MPI_Win_create_dynamic) and 
synchronization operations (MPI_Win_lock/unlock, MPI_Win_flush, 
MPI_Win_flush_local, MPI_Win_lock_all/unlock_all,
MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait and MPI_Win_fence). For active synchronization,
suppose users run with MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait, the origin process calls 
MPI_Put to directly place data of a certain size in the remote process's window 
and then waiting on a synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for completion. The remote
process participates in synchronization with MPI_Win_post and
MPI_Win_wait calls. Several iterations of this test is carried
out and the average put latency numbers is reported. The latency includes
the synchronization time also. For passive synchronization, suppose users run with
MPI_Win_lock/unlock, the origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the
target process's window and calls MPI_Put to directly place data of certain 
size in the window. Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure completion of the 
Put and release lock on the window. This is carried out for several iterations and the
average time for MPI_Lock + MPI_Put + MPI_Unlock calls is measured. The default
window initialization and synchronization operations are MPI_Win_allocate and
MPI_Win_flush. The benchmark offers the following options: 
"-w create"       use MPI_Win_create to create an MPI Window object.

synchronization operations (MPI_Win_lock/unlock, MPI_Win_flush, 
MPI_Win_flush_local, MPI_Win_lock_all/unlock_all,
MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait and MPI_Win_fence). For active synchronization,
suppose users run with MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait, the origin
process calls MPI_Get to directly fetch data of a certain size from the
target process's window into a local buffer. It then waits on a
synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for local completion of the Gets. 
The remote process participates in synchronization with MPI_Win_post and
MPI_Win_wait calls. Several iterations of this test is carried
out and the average get latency numbers is reported. The latency includes
the synchronization time also. For passive synchronization, suppose users run
with MPI_Win_lock/unlock, the origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the 
target process's window and calls MPI_Get to directly read data of certain

This test is similar to the bandwidth test, except that both the processes
involved send out a fixed number of back-to-back MPI_Puts and wait for their

suppose users run with MPI_Win_Post/Start/Complete/Wait, the origin 
process calls MPI_Accumulate to combine data from the local buffer with
the data in the remote window and store it in the remote window. The
combining operation used in the test is MPI_SUM. The origin process then
waits on a synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for completion
of the operations. The remote process waits on a MPI_Win_wait call. Several 
iterations of this test are carried out and the average accumulate latency 
number is obtained. The latency includes the synchronization time also. 
For passive synchronization, suppose users run with
MPI_Win_lock/unlock, the origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the
target process's window and calls MPI_Accumulate to combine data from a 
local buffer with the data in the remote window and store it in the remote window. 
Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure completion of the Accumulate and release
lock on the window. This is carried out for several iterations and the
average time for MPI_Lock + MPI_Accumulate + MPI_Unlock calls is
measured. The default window initialization and synchronization operations are 
MPI_Win_allocate and MPI_Win_flush. The benchmark offers the following options: 
"-w create"       use MPI_Win_create to create an MPI Window object.
"-w allocate"     use MPI_Win_allocate to create an MPI Window object.

In addition to support for communications to and from GPU memories allocated
using CUDA or OpenACC, we now provide additional capability of performing 
communications to and from buffers allocated using the CUDA Managed Memory
concept. CUDA Managed (or Unified) Memory allows applications to allocate 
memory on either CPU or GPU memories using the cudaMallocManaged() call. This
allows user oblivious transfer of the memory buffer between the CPU or GPU.
Currently, we offer benchmarking with CUDA Managed Memory using the tests 
mentioned above. These benchmarks have additional options:
"M" allocates a send or receive buffer as managed for point to point communication.
"-d managed" uses managed memory buffers to perform collective communications.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_put</strong> - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Put Routine</li>
This benchmark measures latency of a shmem putmem operation for different
data sizes. The user is required to select whether the communication
buffers should be allocated in global memory or heap memory, through a
parameter. The test requires exactly two PEs. PE 0 issues shmem putmem to
write data at PE 1 and then calls shmem quiet. This is repeated for a
fixed number of iterations, depending on the data size. The average
latency per iteration is reported. A few warm-up iterations are run
without timing to ignore any start-up overheads.  Both PEs call shmem
barrier all after the test for each message size.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_put_nb</strong> - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Non-blocking Put Routine</li>
This benchmark measures the non-blocking latency of a shmem putmem_nbi 
operation for different data sizes. The user is required to select 
whether the communication buffers should be allocated in global 
memory or heap memory, through a parameter. The test requires exactly 
two PEs. PE 0 issues shmem putmem_nbi to write data at PE 1 and then calls 
shmem quiet. This is repeated for a fixed number of iterations, depending 
on the data size. The average latency per iteration is reported. 
A few warm-up iterations are run without timing to ignore any start-up 
overheads. Both PEs call shmem barrier all after the test for each message size.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_get</strong> - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Get Routine</li>
This benchmark is similar to the one above except that PE 0 does a shmem
getmem operation to read data from PE 1 in each iteration. The average
latency per iteration is reported.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_get_nb</strong> -  Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Non-blocking Get Routine</li>
This benchmark is similar to the one above except that PE 0 does a shmem
getmem_nbi operation to read data from PE 1 in each iteration. The average
latency per iteration is reported.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_put_mr</strong> - Message Rate Test for OpenSHMEM Put Routine</li>
This benchmark measures the aggregate uni-directional operation rate of
OpenSHMEM Put between pairs of PEs, for different data sizes. The user
should select for communication buffers to be in global memory and heap
memory as with the earlier benchmarks. This test requires number of PEs
to be even. The PEs are paired with PE 0 pairing with PE n/2 and so on,
where n is the total number of PEs. The first PE in each pair issues
back-to-back shmem putmem operations to its peer PE. The total time for
the put operations is measured and operation rate per second is reported.
All PEs call shmem barrier all after the test for each message size.

The user should select for communication buffers to be in global memory 
and heap memory as with the earlier benchmarks. This test requires number 
of PEs to be even. The PEs are paired with PE 0 pairing with PE n/2 and so on,
where n is the total number of PEs. The first PE in each pair issues
back-to-back shmem putmem_nbi operations to its peer PE until the window
size. A call to shmem_quite is placed after the window loop to ensure
completion of the issued operations. The total time for the non-blocking 
put operations is measured and operation rate per second is reported.
All PEs call shmem barrier all after the test for each message size.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_put_overlap</strong> - Non-blocking Message Rate Overlap Test
This benchmark measures the aggregate uni-directional operations rate
overlap for OpenSHMEM Put between paris of PEs, for different data sizes.
The user should select for communication buffers to be in global memory
and heap memory as with the earlier benchmarks. This test requires number
of PEs. The benchmarks prints statistics for different phases of
communication, computation and overlap in the end.

<li><strong>osu_oshm_atomics</strong> - Latency and Operation Rate Test for OpenSHMEM Atomics Routines
This benchmark measures the performance of atomic fetch-and-operate and
atomic operate routines supported in OpenSHMEM for the integer
and long datatypes. The buffers can be selected to be in heap memory or global
memory. The PEs are paired like in the case of Put Operation Rate
benchmark and the first PE in each pair issues back-to-back atomic
operations of a type to its peer PE. The average latency per atomic
operation and the aggregate operation rate are reported.  This is
repeated for each of fadd, finc, add, inc, cswap, swap, set, and fetch 
routines.

    <li>Collective Latency Tests</li>
    The latest OMB Version includes benchmarks for various OpenSHMEM
    collective operations (shmem_collect, shmem_fcollect, shmem_broadcast, 
    shmem_reduce and shmem_barrier). These benchmarks work in the following 
    manner. Suppose users run the osu_oshm_broadcast benchmark with N 
    processes, the benchmark measures the min, max and the average latency of 
    the shmem_broadcast collective operation across N processes, for various
    message lengths, over a large number of iterations. In the default
    version, these benchmarks report the average latency for each message
    length. Additionally, the benchmarks offer the following options:

<li><strong>osu_upc_memput</strong> - Latency Test for UPC Put Routine</li>
This benchmark measures the latency of UPC put operation between multiple UPC
threads. In this benchmark, UPC threads with ranks less than (THREADS/2)
issue UPC memput operations to peer UPC threads. Peer threads are identified
as (MYTHREAD+THREADS/2). This is repeated for a fixed number of iterations, for
varying data sizes. The average latency per iteration is reported. A few
warm-up iterations are run without timing to ignore any start-up overheads. All
UPC threads call UPC barrier after the test for each message size.

<li><strong>osu_upc_memget</strong> - Latency Test for UPC Get Routine</li> 
This benchmark is similar as the UPC put benchmark that is described above.
The difference is that the shared string handling function is upc_memget. The
average get operation latency per iteration is reported.

This benchmark measures the latency of async_copy (memput) operation
between multiple UPC++ threads. In this benchmark, UPC++ threads with ranks
less than (ranks()/2) copy data from their local memory to their peer
thread’s memory using async_copy operation. By changing the source and destination
buffers in async_copy, we can mimic the behavior of upc_memput and upc_memget.
Peer threads are identified as (myrank()+ranks()/2). This is
repeated for a fixed number of iterations, for varying data sizes. The
average latency per iteration is reported. A few warm-up iterations are run
without timing to ignore any start-up overheads. All UPC++ threads call
barrier() function after the test for each message size.

Similar to osu_upcxx_async_copy_put, this benchmark mimics the behavior of
upc_memget and measures the latency of async_copy (memget) operation
between multiple UPC++ threads. The only difference is that the source and destination
buffers in async_copy are swapped. In this benchmark, UPC++ threads with
ranks less than (ranks()/2) copy data from their peer thread's memory
to their local memory using async_copy operation. The rest of the details
are same as discussed above. The average get operation latency per
iteration is reported.

<li><strong>osu_nccl_latency</strong> - Latency Test </li>
The latency tests are carried out in a ping-pong fashion. The sender
sends a message with a certain data size to the receiver and waits for a
reply from the receiver. The receiver receives the message from the sender
and sends back a reply with the same data size. Many iterations of this
ping-pong test are carried out and average one-way latency numbers are
obtained. Non-Blocking version of NCCL functions (ncclSend and ncclRecv) are
used in the tests.

<li><strong>osu_nccl_bw</strong> - Bandwidth Test</li>
The bandwidth tests are carried out by having the sender sending out a
fixed number (equal to the window size) of back-to-back messages to the
receiver and then waiting for a reply from the receiver. The receiver
sends the reply only after receiving all these messages. This process is
repeated for several iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on
the elapsed time (from the time sender sends the first message until the
time it receives the reply back from the receiver) and the number of bytes
sent by the sender. The objective of this bandwidth test is to determine
the maximum sustained date rate that can be achieved at the network level.
Thus, non-blocking version of NCCL functions (ncclSend and ncclRecv) are
used in the test.

<li><strong>osu_nccl_bibw</strong> - Bidirectional Bandwidth Test</li>
The bidirectional bandwidth test is similar to the bandwidth test, except
that both the nodes involved send out a fixed number of back-to-back
messages and wait for the reply. This test measures the maximum
sustainable aggregate bandwidth by two nodes.

The OMB Python extension offers a variety of point-to-point and collective benchmarks to evaluate communication performance of MPI-based parallel applications in Python. This extension utilizes the mpi4py library to provide Python bindings for the MPI standard. The extension supports a variety of Python buffers including NumPy, CuPy, Numba, and PyCUDA. In addition to the CPU tests, GPU benchmarks are supported by selecting the CUDA-aware buffers. Tests with serialized communicated objects are also supported by using the –pickle runtime flag. The –min and –max flags are used specify the upper and lower bounds for tested message size. The –iterations and –skip flags are used to set the number of testing and warmup iterations for each message size. To enable the Python extension, please configure OMB with the –enable-python option.
